			<p id="p1">My name is Brandon Lawrence. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. I am a first-year scholar in the Smash Program. I am a rising sophomore at Tucker High School. I live at home with a single mother. My mom means the world to me. I do not know what I would do if she wasn't here to take care of me. I am grateful to have her in my life even throughout all times we 
			argued. I am an only child on my mom side. I have two step-brothers on my dad side. </p>
		
			<p id="p2">At Tucker High School I am apart of the Tucker Ambush of Sound, which is our marching band. I play the trumpet in the band. We call ourselves the Royal Trumpet Mafia(R.T.M.). I also play the flugelhorn separately from the band. Outside of school, I partake in Boy Scouts. I am a Star Scout on my way to becoming a Life Scout and eventually become an Eagle Scout. In my free time, I like to play video games or hang out with my friends. Some of my favorite games to play are NBA2k, Kingdom Hearts, and Naruto Storm 4. I love to travel with my mom. Some places I have been to are New York, Jamaica, and Florida.</p>
